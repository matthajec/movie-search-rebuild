# Movie Search Rebuild (of [this](https://github.com/matthajec/react-movie-search-app))
## Description
This is an app to find and browse movies. It uses [TMDb's](https://www.themoviedb.org/) REST API. It's a rebuild of the [original](https://github.com/matthajec/react-movie-search-app) one I made because I've improved my skills a lot since making that project and updating it would be more/just as much work as recreating it entirely.

## Frameworks/Package(s)
* ReactJs
* MaterialUI
* TypeScript
